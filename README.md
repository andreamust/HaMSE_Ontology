# HaMSE Ontology
This repository contains the code developed for the Master Thesis in Digital Humanities and Digital Knwoledge at the University of Bologna, under the supervision of Prof. Aldo Gangemi and the supervision of Prof. Albert Meroño Peñuela.
Afterwards, the work was expanded and revised for the following publication:
---
Andrea Poltronieri, & Aldo Gangemi (2022). The HaMSE Ontology: Using Semantic Technologies to support Music Representation Interoperability and Musicological Analysis. CoRR, abs/2202.05817.

---
More specifically, the repository three main types of resources:
* the code used to extract different features from music content [src folder](#src).
* the [HaMSE ontology](#schema), which proposes to represent these features
* a small [Knowledge Base](#data), containing an example of data extracted with the algorithms aforementioned and modelled using the HaMSE Ontology.
